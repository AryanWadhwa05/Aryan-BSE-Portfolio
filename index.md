# Raspberry Pi Object Recognition
I am using Raspberry Pi to identify objects through video, webcam, and images. I used TensorFlow Lite to train and run my Object Detection models on the raspberry pi.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the implemention of a few object detection model. I used a TensorFlow Lite Model Maker google colab notebook to help guide me upload a object detection dataset and split it into training and testing data. I was able to set up my dataset finding images ont he internet and drawing boxes with labels around the object I want to detect for the computer to recognize. I used and imported the TensorFlow Lite library which makes training and testing a model much easier with only a few lines of code.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is detecting object on my Raspberry Pi. I installed mutiple libraries such as TensorFlow and OpenCV to test a TensorFlow Lite pre-trained model on my Raspberry Pi. I downloaded the pre-trained model as detect.tflite from the official Tensor Flow github. I was able to use VNC Viewer to quickly import test images and videos. After that, I was able to run my tflite and Labels file to detect people through my Raspberry Pi camera. I was also able to detect birds and deer through google images.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor/pc. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the nessecary cables were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. I downloaded Raspberry Pi imager directly from the official Raspberry Pi website. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspberry Pi OS supported by the Raspberry Pi. The imager allowed me to image Raspian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi, connected my HDMI cable and rebooted the system until Raspian booted up. I then enabled VNC on the Raspberry Pi so that I was able to use VNC Viewer on my desktop to work on my Raspberry Pi.
