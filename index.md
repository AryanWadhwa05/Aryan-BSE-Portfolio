# Raspberry Pi Image Recognition
I am using a camera connected to my raspberry pi to identify images and objects.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my monitor/pc. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the nessecary cables were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. I downloaded Raspberry Pi imager directly from the official Raspberry Pi website. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspberry Pi OS supported by the Raspberry Pi. Debian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to download Debian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi, connected my HDMI cable and rebooted the system until Debian booted up. Then, I enabled VNC and SSH on the Raspberry Pi so that I was able to use PuTTY and VNC Viewer on my desktop to work on my Raspberry Pi. I downloaded VNC Viewer and PuTTY, both from their official websites and simply put in the Raspberry Pi IP address along with username and password to launch into my remote controled Raspberry Pi.
